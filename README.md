Solar Calculator

10-Minute Plan: This plan is meant to give readers and contributors a general layout of
the code and documents contained within this project. 

The overarching goal of the code contained within this project is to make a function that 
provides solar panel energy generation potential.

First, I will make a function called Solar_Power_Calculator that takes latitude, day of 
the year, and hour of the day as inputs, and as an output returns the watts per square 
meter of power that the sun transmits to the earth (without cloud cover) at that given 
time and place. 
  
Then, I will make a function called Solar_Energy_Calculator that takes latitude, area of 
solar panels, and solar panel efficiency as inputs and as an output returns the number of 
kWh that those panels will generate in a year and a graph that shows the energy 
production curve of those panels over the year.  Again, this function doesn't take weather
patterns into account

Third, my final goal is to create a function that takes latitude, longitude, installed capacity of 
solar panels, and the efficiency of those solar panels as inputs.  As outputs, it will 
return the number of kWh that those panels will generate in a year and a graph that shows 
the energy production curve of those panels over the year.  This function will take 
weather patterns into account.

Any plots or tables that come from analysis will be contained in the results directory.

Final manuscripts and the final wind map can be found in the doc directory.
